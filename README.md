Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering is the most the crucial part of our Machine Learning model building journey and it has always been the most sought after skill for a data scientist. Models can perform well only when we provide clean and concise Features in our data with the help of techniques called Feature Engineering. We will learn a series of techniques which we employ for getting the best possible set of input Features from which our model can find insights and there by helping us make predictions for us in Production after its deployment which will be ultimate goal of ML model Life Cycle Management 

Techniques in Feature Engineering:

1) Perform Feature Selection techniques 
2) Working with Numerical Data 
3) Handle missing data, Impute NAN values 
4) Working and Encoding Categorical data  
5) Perform Bucketing of continuos data into categorical data
6) Working with Nominal data and building faatures from them
7) Perform Feature Correalation and use the correct set of features to input data
8) Perform Feature Scaling, Normalization to get the Features to similar magnitude 
9) Reducing complexity by implementing Dimensionality Reduction techniques
10) Feature Extraction techniques for Text and Image data
