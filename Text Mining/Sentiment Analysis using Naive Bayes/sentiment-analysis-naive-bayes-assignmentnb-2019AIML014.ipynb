    "# Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes\n",
    "In this assignment, we will attempt to label tweets with sentiments (positive, neutral and negative) using Naive Bayes classifier, which has already been studied by you. Naive Bayes is a very basic approach to this problem, but gives surprisingly good accuracy sometimes. There are several elegant libraries for this problem, one of which will be briefly introduced in this notebook later. <br> \n",
    "<br> \n",
    "**Note:** Since Naive Bayes is a basic algorithm, a couple of very useful sklearn features have been incorporated in this assignment. They will help you write much more robust and clean code, and are applicable to any ML code you write. <br> \n",

    "**Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER)** is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. VADER does not requires any training data but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon. (A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features e.g., words, which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative.). VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews. This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.\n",
