When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\\nhappened that protracted my stay.\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 5\\n\\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\\nof my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was\\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\n\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\\nform?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\\nbeautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered\\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\n\\n', '\\nchapter 6\\n\\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.  You are\\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions.  For a long time I have thought\\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  I have\\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\\nperform it myself!  I figure to myself that the task of attending on\\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\\nyour poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed\\nyou are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.\\n\\n“Get well—and return to us.  You will find a happy, cheerful home and\\nfriends who love you dearly.  Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.  How pleased you would\\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest!  He is now sixteen and full\\nof activity and spirit.  He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\\nelder brother returns to us.  My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\\npowers of application.  He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\\nlake.  I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.  But\\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.  What would be\\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?  And how, Victor, can\\nI relate our misfortune?  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\\nson?  I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\\n\\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\\nwalk in Plainpalais.  The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\\nour walk farther than usual.  It was already dusk before we thought of\\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\\non before, were not to be found.  We accordingly rested on a seat until\\nthey should return.  Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 8\\n\\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\\ncommence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.  During the whole of\\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.  It was to\\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of\\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\\nignominious grave, and I the cause!  A thousand times rather would I\\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\\n\\nThe appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and\\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful.  Yet she appeared confident in\\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.  She\\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the\\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\\nseated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\\nher utter guiltlessness.\\n']\n"

      "['Chapter 1\\n\\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\\ndistinguished of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years\\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\\nsituations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who\\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\\nbusiness.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\\nhusband and the father of a family.\\n\\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\\nrefrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a\\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\\nmischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,\\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\\nwretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\\nso little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in\\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.', 'Chapter 2\\n\\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\\nour ages.  I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\\ndisunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\\nnearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\\ncauses.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\\nearliest sensations I can remember.\\n\\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He\\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\\nof the infidels. ', 'Chapter 3\\n\\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.  I had\\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My\\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\\n\\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 4\\n\\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the\\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In\\nM. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by\\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways\\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at\\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\\n\\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\\nwas rapid.  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\\nmy proficiency that of the masters.  Professor Krempe often asked me,\\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years\\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\\nhoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive\\nof the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as\\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\\nuniversity.  When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\\nhappened that protracted my stay.\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 5\\n\\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\\nof my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was\\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\\n\\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\\nform?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\\nbeautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered\\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\\n\\n', '\\nchapter 6\\n\\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.  You are\\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions.  For a long time I have thought\\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  I have\\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\\nperform it myself!  I figure to myself that the task of attending on\\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\\nyour poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed\\nyou are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.\\n\\n“Get well—and return to us.  You will find a happy, cheerful home and\\nfriends who love you dearly.  Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.  How pleased you would\\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest!  He is now sixteen and full\\nof activity and spirit.  He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\\nelder brother returns to us.  My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\\npowers of application.  He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\\nlake.  I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.  But\\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.  What would be\\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?  And how, Victor, can\\nI relate our misfortune?  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\\nson?  I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\\n\\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\\nwalk in Plainpalais.  The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\\nour walk farther than usual.  It was already dusk before we thought of\\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\\non before, were not to be found.  We accordingly rested on a seat until\\nthey should return.  Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\\n\\n', '\\nChapter 8\\n\\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\\ncommence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.  During the whole of\\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.  It was to\\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of\\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\\nignominious grave, and I the cause!  A thousand times rather would I\\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\\n\\nThe appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and\\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful.  Yet she appeared confident in\\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.  She\\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the\\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\\nseated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\\nher utter guiltlessness.\\n']\n"
