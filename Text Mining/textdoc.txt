1) Why does NVDIMM doesn't support compute nodes?
2) Big and Small Controllers differences 
3) No need of 105, 106 VLAN's in our RHEV deployment appropriate VLAN's needs to mentioned in the Legend

Installing and Configuring DNS on RHEL

Step 1: Installing BIND DNS
1.	Install Bind DNS and its utilities on rhel server
# yum install bind bind-utils
2.	Start the DNS service (named daemon) for now, then enable it to auto-start at system boot and check if it is up and running using the below commands
# systemctl start named
# systemctl enable named
#systemctl status named
Step 2: Configuring BIND DNS
3.	To configure Bind DNS server, first we need to take a backup of the original configuration file /etc/named.conf using following cp command.
# cp /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.orig
4.	Open /etc/named.conf configuration file for editing as follows
# vi /etc/named.conf
5.	Under the options configuration section, comment out the following lines.
                
6.	Now look for the allow-query parameter and set its value to our network, which means that only the hosts on our local network can query the DNS Server.
Example: 
 
Step 3: Creating the Forward and Reverse DNS Zones
7.	To define the forward and reverse zones, add the following lines at the end of the  /etc/named.conf file.
Example: where 
i.	openstack.int: Domain
ii.	openstack.int.db: Forward Zone file
iii.	openstack.int.rev: Reverse Zone file
	 
Brief information 
?	type: Defines the role of the server for the zone. The value “master” means it’s an authoritative server where the master copy of the zone data is maintained.
?	file: specifies the zone’s database file.
?	allow-update: specifies the hosts which allowed to submit Dynamic DNS updates for master zones. None in the above example.

Step 4: Creating Forward DNS Zone file

8.	Create a Forward zone file under the /var/named directory and add the configurations as shown in below example.
# vi /var/named/<Forward DNS zone file name>
	  Example: In the below screen shot 192.168.10.15 is local network which will be primary DNS server 
	 	
Brief details:
TTL: specifies the time-to-live of the RR(Resource Record) and $TTL directive gives a default TTL for every RR without a specific TTL set.
?	@: It is an alias for the domain name (e.g Openstack.int) defined in the main configuration file.
?	IN: means the Internet.
?	SOA: specifies the Start of Authority: who the authoritative name server is (dns-Ppimary.openstack.int), the administrator’s contact info (admin.openstack.int, the @ sign is replaced by a period) and other related information.
?	NS: means name server.
?	Serial: this value is used by the DNS server to verify that the contents of a particular zone file are up-to-date.
?	Refresh: specifies how often a slave DNS server should perform a zone transfer from the master.
?	Retry: specifies how often a slave should retry a failed zone transfer.
?	Expire: determines how long a slave server should wait before answering client query when a master is unreachable.
?	Minimum: sets the minimum TTL for the zone.
?	A: A host address.
?	Client server information will be added under PTR records

Step 5: Creating Reverse DNS Zone file
9.	Similarly, create a Reverse Zone file unser /var/named directory and add the configurations as shown in below example. 
# vi /var/named/<Reverse DNS zone file name>
Here, the PTR us the opposite of A record used to map an IP address to a hostname.
Add DNS client server information under PTR records

 
10.	Set the correct ownership permission on the zone files as follows.
# chown :named /var/named/<Forward DNS zone file>
# chown :named /var/named/<Reverse DNS zone file>
11.	 Finally, check the DNS configuration and the zone files has the correct syntax after making the above changes, using the named-checkconf utility (no out means no error)
# named-checkconf
# named-checkzone <Domain name> /var/named/<Foward DNS zone file>
# named-checkzone <Domain name> /var/named/<Reverse DNS zone file>
Example: 
12.	Restart the DNS service for the recent changes to take effect.
# systemctl restart named
13.	If firewall is not disabled, add the DNS service in the system firewall configuration and reload the firewall settings using below commands.
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=dns
# firewall-cmd --reload
If firewall is disabled, we can ignore this step. 
Step 6: Testing DNS Service from Client
14.	Login to client machine and configure it to use the above DNS Server. Open the file /etc/resolv.conf and add the DNS server entry which tells the resolver to use the specified nameserver. 
# vi /etc/resolve.conf
Add ? nameserver  <DNS Server IP>
Save the file and close it. Also specify the DNS server in the network interface configuration file. 
15.	Add the DNS Server IP as resolver to the client machine network interface configuration file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/<interface> as shown in the below example.
16.	Use nslookup utility to query the IP using the hostname and vise versa.
Example: In this PTR record has been created for www, mail and docs server in the network. 
17.	Same way we can add multiple DNS client entries under PTR record, both in Forward & Reverse DNS zone files. Then, update the DNS entries at the client server interface level. Finally, we would be able to resolve the IP/hostname of particular DNS client server.
